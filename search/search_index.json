It\u2019s a shame that we only have one day for the wedding and reception, so we wanted to share a schedule with you all so you know where we are are can join us in what we are doing! We want to spend time with you, so PLEASE join us in these various activities to make for more opportunity for joy and revelry. Schedule to Come The Welcome Dinner\u2060\u2014 Dec. 20 We will be hosting a welcome dinner on the night of December 20 for all those who have come out of town for this special occasion. While we would love to have another chance to celebrate with you all, we have limited space at the venue, so we\u2019ve limited the attendees to those who had to travel the extra distance for the wedding. Your RSVP should state whether you will attend the welcome dinner, but if you have questions, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Location: 2000 Post St. Time: 4:00-8pm Dress Code: This dinner is meant to be a casual event, so don\u2019t feel the need to dress up! As a fun challenge, try to wear blues and purples to match Cam and Quinn\u2019s favorite colors! The Ceremony\u2060\u2014 Dec. 21 Because neither of us particularly enjoy too much attention on us, we have decided to have a small ceremony the morning of December 21 in Golden Gate Park. For those who will be participating in the ceremony, please refer to this document for more details. The Reception\u2060\u2014 Dec. 21 We are fortunate enough that Cam\u2019s aunt and uncle, DD and Tommy Gray, have opened their home for our wedding reception. We are excited to have you all! The intent of the reception is to mimic a family party. So for those who live nearby and are only able to visit for a few hours, you\u2019re welcome to come and go. For those who are traveling or just want more time to hang out with us all, you can come for the entire time! There will be plenty of food, games, karaoke, and other fun activities. Date: December 21, 2025 Location: [photo of Gray house] Time: 1-8pm Dress Code: Nice and comfortable winter wear. The reception is not a formal occasion, so please leave your suits and gowns at home! Wear something that you\u2019d wear for a holiday party\u2060\u2014 nice sweaters and pants. It\u2019ll definitely be cold, so be prepared!

The average temperatures range from a high of 58\u2109 and a low of 46\u2109. While it is not likely to rain, there is still a chance that it will. What to wear The best suggestion we can give to surviving San Francisco regardless of the time of year is to wear many light layers. This is particularly true if you are traveling across the city. Walking up hills can warm you up quickly, but each neighborhood in the city has its own microclimate, so it can be many degrees warmer or colder depending on where you end up. Windy Bring a light rain jacket just in case it is misty or rainy during the week. Bring good walking shoes! We love the city for its walkability and good public transit, but the hills can be quite daunting, so preparing with good footwear helps! A medium-heavy jacket would be good, particularly for those of you coming from Texas, as the windy, foggy nature of the city can take a bit of getting used to.","title":"Weather"},{"location":"weather/#weather","text":"Weather What to expect What to wear Windy","title":"Weather"},{"location":"weather/#what-to-expect","text":"The weather in San Francisco is fairly constant throughout the year, but December does tend towards colder weather.
