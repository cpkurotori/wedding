Weddings are both a celebration of two people committing to one another, and a joining of two families. As neither Cam nor I are ones to enjoy too much attention on ourselves, we want to emphasize the latter interpretation of a wedding as we celebrate with all of you. Because of this, our wedding will be informal but filled with love, family, and friends. 

Due to the smaller nature of the wedding, the ceremony will be small with only the nuclear family and wedding party attending. But for those who have kindly made the far trek to San Francisco from all corners of the country, we will be having a welcome party along with the reception. We also welcome everyone to the various activities and preparations we will be doing in the week leading up to the celebration so we can spend as much time as possible with those we love.
