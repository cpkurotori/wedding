## What to expect
The weather in San Francisco is fairly constant throughout the year, but December does tend towards colder weather. The average temperatures range from a high of 58℉ and a low of 46℉. While it is not likely to rain, there is still a chance that it will.

## What to wear
The best suggestion we can give to surviving San Francisco regardless of the time of year is to wear many light layers. This is particularly true if you are traveling across the city. Walking up hills can warm you up quickly, but each neighborhood in the city has its own microclimate, so it can be many degrees warmer or colder depending on where you end up. 

### Windy

Bring a light rain jacket just in case it is misty or rainy during the week. 

Bring good walking shoes! We love the city for its walkability and good public transit, but the hills can be quite daunting, so preparing with good footwear helps! 

A medium-heavy jacket would be good, particularly for those of you coming from Texas, as the windy, foggy nature of the city can take a bit of getting used to.
