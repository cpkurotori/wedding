# Pre-Wedding Events

We will be spending the week before the wedding preparing for 
the event, and we hope to spend as much time with you all as
we can! It’s a shame that we only have one day for the 
wedding and reception, so we wanted to share a schedule 
with you all so you know where we are and can join us. 
We want to spend time with you, so PLEASE join us in these 
various activities to make for more opportunity for joy and
revelry.
