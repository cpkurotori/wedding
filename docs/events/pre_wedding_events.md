# Pre-Wedding Events

We will be spending the week before the wedding preparing for the event, and we hope to spend as much time with you all as we can! Itâ€™s a shame that we only have one day for the wedding and reception, so we wanted to share a schedule with you all so you know where we are are can join us in what we are doing! We want to spend time with you, so PLEASE join us in these various activities to make for more opportunity for joy and revelry.
