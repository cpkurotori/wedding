## When

Sunday, December 21th 2025

1 PM - 8 PM

## Where

**Dee Dee and Tom Gray's House[^1]**

3235 Curtis Circle, Pleasanton, CA 94588


## What

We are fortunate enough that Cam’s Aunt and Uncle, Dee Dee and Tom Gray, have opened their home for our wedding reception. We are excited to have you all!

Our desire is for our reception to feel like a family party. So for those who live nearby and are only able to visit for a few hours, you’re welcome to come and go. For those who are traveling or just want more time to hang out with us all, you can come for the entire time! There will be plenty of food, games, karaoke, and other fun activities.

## Dress Code

Nice and comfortable winter wear. The reception is not a formal occasion, so please leave your suits and gowns at home! Wear something that you’d wear for a holiday party⁠— nice sweaters and pants. The reception will take place both indoors and outdoors, so bring layers just in case. There will be heaters, though, so you should never be too cold.

## What to Bring

Celebrating with you is all we want, truly!

[^1]: Cam's aunt and uncle's house was the location of many parties and family get-togethers over the years. Because of the core memories and good feelings associated with this house, we wanted to capture the same feelings of love and warmth for the celebration of our union.
