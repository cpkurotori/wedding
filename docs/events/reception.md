[TOC]

## When

Sunday, December 21th 2025

1 PM - 8 PM

## Where

**DD and Tom Gray's House[^1]**

3235 Curtis Circle, Pleasanton, CA 94588

## What

We are fortunate enough that Cam’s Aunt and Uncle, DD and Tom Gray, have opened their home for our wedding reception. We are excited to have you all!

The intent of the reception is to simply be a family party. So for those who live nearby and are only able to visit for a few hours, you’re welcome to come and go. For those who are traveling or just want more time to hang out with us all, you can come for the entire time! There will be plenty of food, games, karaoke, and other fun activities.

## Dress Code

Nice and comfortable winter wear. The reception is not a formal occasion, so please leave your suits and gowns at home! Wear something that you’d wear for a holiday party⁠— nice sweaters and pants. It’ll definitely be cold, so be prepared! 

## What to Bring

Celebrating with you is all we want, truly!

[^1]: Cam's aunt and uncle's house was the location of many parties and family get-togethers over the years. Because of the core memories and good feelings associated with this house, we wanted to capture the same feelings of love and warmth for the celebration of our union.
