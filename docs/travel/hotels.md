## In San Francisco

There are many many options in the city for you to stay, but here are our suggested locations. They are either close to Japantown (near where we live and where the welcome dinner will take place) or close to a BART station for easy access to the public transit both to the airport and to Pleasanton where the reception is taking place.

### Queen Anne

## In Pleasanton

While there isn’t as much to do in Pleasanton as San Francisco, it is where the reception is taking place, so it would make a convenient location to stay if you are only coming for the day of the wedding. It’s a cute town with a wonderful downtown. It’s also the city where Cam grew up. A few good locations to stay include:
