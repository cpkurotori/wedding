## In San Francisco

There are many many options in the city for you to stay, but here are our suggested locations. They are either close to Japantown (near where we live and where the welcome dinner will take place) or close to a BART station for easy access to the public transit both to the airport and to Pleasanton where the reception is taking place.

It’s a cute town with a wonderful downtown. It’s also the city where Cam grew up. A few good locations to stay include:
