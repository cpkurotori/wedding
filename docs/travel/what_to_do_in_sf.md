### Ocean Beach

Ocean Beanch the beach on the west coast of the city. While the water may be freezing, the sunsets are beautiful. If you go here you can walk around Sutro Baths and Sutro Heights.

### Union Square

Union Square is the center of many shops in downtown. Currently there is ice skating in Union Square and a huge Christmas tree. Very much a Christmas in the City cibe.

### Fisherman's Wharf

Fisherman's Wharf has a lot of fun activities such as the historic penny arcade, Pier 39, Boudin's, and much more.

### Japantown

Japantown is a great place to get japanese food and items. We love walking around the mall and shopping in the many unique stores here.

### Haight Ashbury

Haight Ashbury is hippy central and has great thrift shops and food!

### Golden Gate Park

Golden Gate Park is for those that love a large park. It's extremely walkable and has 
some great attractions like the De Young Museum, Cal Academy of Science, the Japanese Tea Garden, the SF Botanical Garden, the Conservatory of Flowers. JFK Promenade has been closed down for cars so it's a great place to walk through.

### Sunset

Sunset has some great food options, like our favorite vegetarian restaurant, Enjoy Vegetarian!

### Richmond

Richmond is home to our favorite farmers market and a lot of our other favorite restaurants, like Burma Superstar and Pasta Supply Co.

### Hayes Valley

Hayes Valley is a cute walking neighborhood with higher end shopping and restaurants and bars.

### Embarcadero/Ferry Building

The Ferry Building is a must do with restaurants and shops. Definitely a fun experience and you can take the ferry to Tiburon or Sausalito and see the city from across the bay.
