# Airports

[TOC]

We are fortunate enough in San Francisco to be located close to three different airports. This should hopefully make finding a flight relatively easy and offers a greater number of options to find the best deal on a flight.

## SFO

The San Francisco International Airport is the closest airport to the city. It is only a 20 minute drive to downtown and is connected by BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), our version of a subway. SFO is the easiest way to travel to San Francisco, and is our main recommendation.

### Getting to San Francisco

It’s very easy to get into the city from the airport. Our underground system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), has a station at the airport and it will go directly into the city from there! 

### Getting to Pleasanton (Reception Location)

Just like going into the city, the best public transit to Pleasanton is our underground system, BART. For this you’ll need a Clipper Card. To get to Pleasanton, you’ll want to transfer from the Yellow Line (the line that goes to the airport) to the Blue Line. From the Blue Line, you’ll want to get off at the East Dublin/Pleasanton station. 

## OAK

The Oakland International Airport is a good alternative. It is closest to Pleasanton, the location of the reception, and it is also connected to BART.

### Getting to San Francisco

It is just as easy to get to the city from the Oakland airport as they also have a BART station. Getting from Oakland, however, will require a transfer from the Brown Line (the line that specifically goes to the Oakland airport) to any of the other lines heading into the city.

### Getting to Pleasanton (Reception Location)

To get to Pleasanton from the Oakland airport, you will need to use BART. You will take the Brown Line, which is the only option at the airport, and then transfer to the Blue Line. The Blue Line will take you directly to the East Dublin/Pleasanton station. 

## SJC⁠

The San Jose Mineta International Airport is still a viable option to flying in to the Bay Area. It’s not the most ideal for getting into the city as it is a significant distance from SF, but it is still close enough if you aren’t able to get a flight into one of the other airports.

### Getting to San Francisco

As San Jose is significantly further from the city than the other airports, it will take longer to travel into San Francisco, but it is still possible! The Airport has a bus that goes to the nearest BART station, from where you can enter the city easily. 

### Getting to Pleasanton (Reception Location)

As San Jose is significantly further from the city than the other airports, it will take longer to travel into San Francisco, but it is still possible! The Airport has a bus that goes to the nearest BART station, from where you take the Green Line to a transfer location at Bay Fair. You then want to transfer to the Blue Line, which will take you all the way to the East Dublin/Pleasanton station.
