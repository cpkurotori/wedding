# Flights and Airports

[TOC]

We are fortunate enough in San Francisco to be located close to three different airports. This should hopefully make finding a flight relatively easy and offers a greater number of options to find the best deal on a flight. For more information about each of the airports, and their relative convenience, read below:

## SFO

The San Francisco International Airport is the closest airport to the city. It is only a 20 minute drive into the city and it is connected by BART, our version of a subway. This would be the best way to travel into San Francisco, and is our main recommendation.

## OAK

The Oakland International Airport is a good alternative. It is closest to Pleasanton, the location of the reception, and it is also connected to BART, the San Francisco Bay Area’s version of a subway. 

## SJC⁠

The San Jose Mineta International Airport is still a viable option to flying in to the Bay Area. It’s not the most ideal for getting into the city as it is a good distance from SF, but it is still close enough if you aren’t able to get a flight into one of the other airports
