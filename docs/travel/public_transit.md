## From the Airport to the City

### SFO

It’s very easy to get into the city from the airport. Our underground system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), has a station at the airport and it will go directly into the city from there! 

### OAK⁠⁠

It is just as easy to get to the city from the Oakland airport as they also have a BART station. Getting from Oakland, however, will require a transfer from the Brown Line (the line that specifically goes to the Oakland airport) to any of the other lines heading into the city.


### SJC⁠⁠

As San Jose is significantly further from the city than the other airports, it will take longer to travel into San Francisco, but it is still possible! The Airport has a bus that goes to the nearest BART station, from where you can enter the city easily. 


## From the Airport to Pleasanton (Reception Location)

Just like going into the city, the best public transit to Pleasanton is our underground system, BART. For this you’ll need a Clipper Card. To get to Pleasanton, you’ll want to transfer from the Yellow Line (the line that goes to the airport) to the Blue Line. From the Blue Line, you’ll want to get off at the Dublin/Pleasanton station. 

### OAK

## From the City to Pleasanton (Reception Location)

The best way to get from San Francisco to Pleasanton is through our underground system, BART. There are multiple entrances into the system, but the most direct ones can be found on Market Street. Regardless of the station, you’ll want to take the Blue Line to the Dublin/Pleasanton station. From there, we will pick you up! We have a schedule of volunteer drivers that will take you to and from the station throughout the afternoon and evening that will take people between the BART station and the reception venue!
