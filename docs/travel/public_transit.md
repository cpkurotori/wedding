# Public Transit

[TOC]

Google Maps does a wonderful job of helping you to get from place to place using the public transportation in San Francisco. 

## Ways to Pay

### Clipper

Clipper is the easiest way to pay for most public transit in the bay area. We recommend following the instructions to Get [Clipper on Your Phone](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/get.html) as buying a physical card will cost $3.

See the [Clipper card website](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/new-to-clipper.html) for more information or don't hesitate to reach out to Cam if you have any questions.

### MuniMobile

MuniMobile is the phone app that can be used to buy tickets for MUNI buses and subways. If you are eligible for senior discounts (+65) or you want to buy a day pass (the cost of 2 single rides), this is the recommended way to pay. 

Keep in mind this only works for the MUNI system which is only for San Francisco and will not work on BART (even within the city).

See [SFMTA](https://www.sfmta.com/munimobile-frequently-asked-questions) for more information or don't hesitate to reach out to Cam if you have any questions.

## Transit Systems

### BART

The Bay Area Rapid Transit is the best way to get around the Bay Area (outside of the city).

#### How to Pay

##### Clipper

You must use [Clipper](#clipper) to pay for BART. Simply tap the card (or your phone) at the fare gate upon entering **and** exiting. Prices are determined by your start and end location.

### Muni

A muni single ride ticket lasts for 2 hours after activation (for both [Clipper](#clipper) and [MuniMobile](#munimobile)). A day pass may be purchased in [MuniMobile](#munimobile) for the price of 2 rides so if you plan on doing a full day of exploring the city, I definitely recommend this.

Note that the standard MUNI ticket cannot be used for the Cable Cards, but you can buy a pass for the cable car on MuniMobile or use Clipper to pay.

#### How to Pay

##### Clipper

To use [Clipper](#clipper) on MUNI bus or subways, enter through any door (or fare gate at stations) and hold your phone or card to the fare scanner until you hear a single beep.

!!! note "Proof of Payment"

    If a fare enforcement officer asks you for proof of payment, tell them you used Clipper and they will ask you to tap your phone/card to their device for them to verify.

##### MuniMobile

Purchase your ticket on the [MuniMobile](#munimobile) app and activate it when you board. Enter through any door and there's no need to show anyone your ticket unless asked by a fare enforcement officer (not very common but it does happen).

If you are entering MUNI from a station with fare gates, go to the handicap fare gate and either show the operator (if present) your ticket and they'll open the gate for you. If they are not present, the handicap fare gate should open when it detects you are there and you simply need to walk through.

!!! warning "Do Not Tap Your Phone"

    Do not tap any fare gates/scanners with your phone. If you do this, it will automatically use Clipper and you'll be paying for both.

### Ferry

If you want to explore some of the surrounding cities in the bay, the ferry is a very fun option! We recommend visiting Tiburon and/or Sausalito via ferry.

#### How to Pay

Most ferrys accept [Clipper](#clipper) card. Be sure to check their websites on how to pay. Some may require you to tap on entry and exit.

### Other

There are other bus providers that service San Francisco (Golden Gate Transit, AC, SamTrans, etc). Sometimes Google Maps will recommend one of these lines when getting through the city and the cost is significantly more than MUNI (and MuniMobile day pass will not work for these).

Unless you are going out of the city, we do not recommend using these options. On Google Maps, you can select a route and scroll down to `Agency info` to see which agencies show up. If you see agencies other than `SFMTA` and `511 SF Bay` then the route likley includes service from another agency.
