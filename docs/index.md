Pre-Wedding Events
We will be spending the week before the wedding preparing for the event, and we hope to spend as much time with you all as we can! It’s a shame that we only have one day for the wedding and reception, so we wanted to share a schedule with you all so you know where we are are can join us in what we are doing! We want to spend time with you, so PLEASE join us in these various activities to make for more opportunity for joy and revelry.

Schedule to Come
The Welcome Dinner⁠— Dec. 20
We will be hosting a welcome dinner on the night of December 20 for all those who have come out of town for this special occasion. While we would love to have another chance to celebrate with you all, we have limited space at the venue, so we’ve limited the attendees to those who had to travel the extra distance for the wedding. Your RSVP should state whether you will attend the welcome dinner, but if you have questions, don’t hesitate to ask. 

Location: 2000 Post St.

Time: 4:00-8pm

Dress Code: This dinner is meant to be a casual event, so don’t feel the need to dress up! As a fun challenge, try to wear blues and purples to match Cam and Quinn’s favorite colors!
The Ceremony⁠— Dec. 21
Because neither of us particularly enjoy too much attention on us, we have decided to have a small ceremony the morning of December 21 in Golden Gate Park.

For those who will be participating in the ceremony, please refer to this document for more details.
The Reception⁠— Dec. 21
We are fortunate enough that Cam’s aunt and uncle, DD and Tommy Gray, have opened their home for our wedding reception. We are excited to have you all! The intent of the reception is to mimic a family party. So for those who live nearby and are only able to visit for a few hours, you’re welcome to come and go. For those who are traveling or just want more time to hang out with us all, you can come for the entire time! There will be plenty of food, games, karaoke, and other fun activities. 

Date: December 21, 2025

Location: [photo of Gray house]


Time: 1-8pm

Dress Code: Nice and comfortable winter wear. The reception is not a formal occasion, so please leave your suits and gowns at home! Wear something that you’d wear for a holiday party⁠— nice sweaters and pants. It’ll definitely be cold, so be prepared!
