What to Expect
Weddings are both a celebration of two people committing to one another, and a joining of two families. As neither Cam nor I are ones to enjoy too much attention on ourselves, we want to emphasize the latter interpretation of a wedding as we celebrate with all of you. Because of this, our wedding will be informal but filled with love, family, and friends. </p>
<p>Due to the smaller nature of the wedding, the ceremony will be small with only the nuclear family and wedding party attending. But for those who have kindly made the far trek to San Francisco from all corners of the country, we will be having a welcome party along with the reception. We also welcome everyone to the various activities and preparations we will be doing in the week leading up to the celebration so we can spend as much time as possible with those we love. </p>
<p>A basic outline for the major events include:</p>
<p>Friday, December 19
    Quinn’s Bachelor Party</p>
<p>Saturday, December 20
Decorating at the Grays 
Welcome Party for Out-Of-Towners 4-8</p>
<p>Sunday, December 21
Ceremony 8:30 am
Reception 1-8 
Pre-Wedding Events
We will be spending the week before the wedding preparing for the event, and we hope to spend as much time with you all as we can! It’s a shame that we only have one day for the wedding and reception, so we wanted to share a schedule with you all so you know where we are are can join us in what we are doing! We want to spend time with you, so PLEASE join us in these various activities to make for more opportunity for joy and revelry.</p>
<p>Schedule to Come
The Welcome Dinner⁠— Dec. 20
We will be hosting a welcome dinner on the night of December 20 for all those who have come out of town for this special occasion. While we would love to have another chance to celebrate with you all, we have limited space at the venue, so we’ve limited the attendees to those who had to travel the extra distance for the wedding. Your RSVP should state whether you will attend the welcome dinner, but if you have questions, don’t hesitate to ask. </p>
<p>Location: 2000 Post St.</p>
<p>Time: 4:00-8pm</p>
<p>Dress Code: This dinner is meant to be a casual event, so don’t feel the need to dress up! As a fun challenge, try to wear blues and purples to match Cam and Quinn’s favorite colors!
The Ceremony⁠— Dec. 21
Because neither of us particularly enjoy too much attention on us, we have decided to have a small ceremony the morning of December 21 in Golden Gate Park.</p>
<p>For those who will be participating in the ceremony, please refer to this document for more details.
The Reception⁠— Dec. 21
We are fortunate enough that Cam’s aunt and uncle, DD and Tommy Gray, have opened their home for our wedding reception. We are excited to have you all! The intent of the reception is to mimic a family party. So for those who live nearby and are only able to visit for a few hours, you’re welcome to come and go. For those who are traveling or just want more time to hang out with us all, you can come for the entire time! There will be plenty of food, games, karaoke, and other fun activities. </p>
<p>Date: December 21, 2025</p>
<p>Location: [photo of Gray house]</p>
<p>Time: 1-8pm</p>
<p>Dress Code: Nice and comfortable winter wear. The reception is not a formal occasion, so please leave your suits and gowns at home! Wear something that you’d wear for a holiday party⁠— nice sweaters and pants. It’ll definitely be cold, so be prepared! </p>

<p>Travel
Flights and Airports
We are fortunate enough in San Francisco to be located close to three different airports. This should hopefully make finding a flight relatively easy and offers a greater number of options to find the best deal on a flight. For more information about each of the airports, and their relative convenience, read below:</p>
<p>SFO⁠— The San Francisco International Airport is the closest airport to the city. It is only a 20 minute drive into the city and it is connected by BART, our version of a subway. This would be the best way to travel into San Francisco, and is our main recommendation.</p>
<p>OAK⁠— The Oakland International Airport is a good alternative. It is closest to Pleasanton, the location of the reception, and it is also connected to BART, the San Francisco Bay Area’s version of a subway. </p>
<p>SJC⁠— The San Jose Mineta International Airport is still a viable option to flying in to the Bay Area. It’s not the most ideal for getting into the city as it is a good distance from SF, but it is still close enough if you aren’t able to get a flight into one of the other airports</p>
<p>Hotels
In San Francisco
There are many many options in the city for you to stay, but here are our suggested locations. They are either close to Japantown (near where we live and where the welcome dinner will take place) or close to a BART station for easy access to the public transit both to the airport and to Pleasanton where the reception is taking place.</p>
<p>Queen Anne 
1590 Sutter St. 
San Francisco, CA 94109</p>
<p>The Queen Anne is a luxury hotel near Japantown in San Francisco. It is where the wedding party will be staying for the wedding, so if you’d like to join them, feel free to get a room!</p>
<p>https://www.queenanne.com/ </p>
<p>Kabuki Hotel
1625 Post St. 
San Francisco, CA 94115</p>
<p>The Kabuki Hotel is a boutique hotel that is a part of Hyatt hotels. It is in Japantown in San Francisco, near Cam and Quinn’s home and very close to Quinn’s work at the Western Addition Branch Library! </p>
<p>We also have a promo code! If you use the following link and immediately click “Book Now,” you’ll be able to take part in the offer. </p>
<p>https://www.hyatt.com/jdv-by-hyatt/en-US/sfojd-jdv-hotel-kabuki?corp_id=128309 </p>
<p>In Pleasanton
While there isn’t as much to do in Pleasanton as San Francisco, it is where the reception is taking place, so it would make a convenient location to stay if you are only coming for the day of the wedding. It’s a cute town with a wonderful downtown. It’s also the city where Cam grew up. A few good locations to stay include:</p>
<p>A
B</p>
<p>Public Transit From the Airport to the City
SFO⁠— It’s very easy to get into the city from the airport. Our underground system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), has a station at the airport and it will go directly into the city from there! 
https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/ground-transportation/public-transit </p>
<p>OAK⁠— It is just as easy to get to the city from the Oakland airport as they also have a BART station. Getting from Oakland, however, will require a transfer from the Brown Line (the line that specifically goes to the Oakland airport) to any of the other lines heading into the city. 
https://www.iflyoak.com/ground-transportation/public-transportation/ </p>
<p>SJC⁠— As San Jose is significantly further from the city than the other airports, it will take longer to travel into San Francisco, but it is still possible! The Airport has a bus that goes to the nearest BART station, from where you can enter the city easily. 
https://www.flysanjose.com/public-transit 
Public Transit From the Airport to Pleasanton (Reception Location)
SFO⁠— Just like going into the city, the best public transit to Pleasanton is our underground system, BART. For this you’ll need a Clipper Card. To get to Pleasanton, you’ll want to transfer from the Yellow Line (the line that goes to the airport) to the Blue Line. From the Blue Line, you’ll want to get off at the Dublin/Pleasanton station. 
https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/ground-transportation/public-transit </p>
<p>OAK⁠— To get to Pleasanton from the Oakland airport, you will need to use BART. You will take the Brown Line, which is the only option at the airport, and then transfer to the Blue Line. The Blue Line will take you directly to the Dublin/Pleasanton station. 
https://www.iflyoak.com/ground-transportation/public-transportation/ </p>
<p>SJC⁠—  As San Jose is significantly further from the city than the other airports, it will take longer to travel into San Francisco, but it is still possible! The Airport has a bus that goes to the nearest BART station, from where you can enter the city easily. You can then transfer to the Blue Line to make your way to the Dublin/Pleasanton station. 
https://www.flysanjose.com/public-transit 
Public Transit From the City to Pleasanton (Reception Location)
The best way to get from San Francisco to Pleasanton is through our underground system, BART. There are multiple entrances into the system, but the most direct ones can be found on Market Street. Regardless of the station, you’ll want to take the Blue Line to the Dublin/Pleasanton station. From there, we will pick you up! We have a schedule of volunteer drivers that will take you to and from the station throughout the afternoon and evening that will take people between the BART station and the reception venue! 
Best Ways to Navigate the City 
Google Maps does a wonderful job of helping you to get from place to place using the public transportation in San Francisco. </p>

<p>Weather</p>
<p>What to expect
The weather in San Francisco is fairly constant throughout the year, but December does tend towards colder weather. The average temperatures range from a high of 58℉ and a low of 46℉. While it is not likely to rain, there is still a chance that it will.</p>
<p>What to wear
The best suggestion we can give to surviving San Francisco regardless of the time of year is to wear many light layers. This is particularly true if you are traveling across the city. Walking up hills can warm you up quickly, but each neighborhood in the city has its own microclimate, so it can be many degrees warmer or colder depending on where you end up. </p>
<p>Windy</p>
<p>Bring a light rain jacket just in case it is misty or rainy during the week. </p>
<p>Bring good walking shoes! We love the city for its walkability and good public transit, but the hills can be quite daunting, so preparing with good footwear helps! </p>
<p>A medium-heavy jacket would be good, particularly for those of you coming from Texas, as the windy, foggy nature of the city can take a bit of getting used to.</p></div>
